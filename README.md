-Twitter Data Pipeline using Airflow

The pipeline facilitates the collection, processing, and analysis of tweet data, allowing users to extract meaningful information and gain actionable insights. This project aims to set up and manage the pipeline, leveraging the scalability and flexibility of cloud-based infrastructure.
